  // TODO: Dive into scenario where any of disabled dates matches selected date.
  //
  // Example: Right now if 29th feb is selected but also requested to disable,
  // then first time rendering the day will be shown selected. But when user
  // selects another day then the 29th feb Day will be disabled, user can't
  // select this day again. Which seems right behaviour.

  // TODO: Showing day name for leap day when system date in non-leap year.
  //
  // If user's device at the time of execution is in non-leap year but
  // configured to show leap year calendar, the leap day is shown for
  // nearest leap year. Here the day name will be shown according to that date
  // for respected leap year. But the other days will render day name with
  // respect to current year. This is making little bit disturbing view for
  // user.
  //
  // For case where system date is in leap year everything works perfectly.
  //
  // Example: System is in 2023 and widget configured to show leap year's
  // Feb's monthly calendar. So with current logic Day widgets will be rendered
  // correctly till 28th, for 29th day it will render leap day with 29/02/2024.
  // So here 28th day shows dayname 'Tue' and 29th day shows dayname 'Thu'
  // because it's from another year. Same when selected, SelectedDate will show
  // 'Thu, 29 Feb', which is not incorrect but little bit inconsistent view for
  // user as 28th is Thuesday and 29th is Thursday, then where is Wednesday.
  //
  // Here need to handle such events, as day names will be shown for current
  // year and this will result in flaw in yearless widget.
  //
  // Possible Resolution:
  // We can overrride requested date formatting option and use alternate
  // formatting function in Day and SelectedDate widget. Identify leap day to
  // indentify such events. If leap year is same as current system year then
  // render normally else use alternate date formatting function.
  // The preferrable format should be matching requested format only exclude
  // showing day.
  // If possible show year in Day widget instead of day name.
  //
  // But still with all these efforts and implementation it will provide
  // incosistent look, because all other Day widgets will show day name and but
  // the leap Day widget will not show day name or year displayed in place of
  // day name.
